## LAA Algorithms Demo

This Space demonstrates a collection of Learning-Augmented Algorithms (LAA). You can interact with the algorithms through the Gradio interface.

### Setup

This Space is configured to use the Gradio SDK and will automatically install the dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file. The `laa_core` Rust library is built and installed as part of the setup process.
